# coinMarketCap-data-manipulation
here we got essensitally two seperate projects

the first one is the data scraper in which i took a dynamically rendered website (coinmarketcap) and scrapped all of the information off of it every couple seconds

and sent it into an sql database, a local one which i dont really use so it doesnt really matter if the keys for this one are public or not

that is not to say i dont care about exposing my keys obviously and anything that actually matters ie: my aws keys are not kept publicly.


the second project is a data visualizer which takes the discord apie and via commands will use mainstream data libraries such as matplotlib in order to visualize
and compare the data gained from the scraper
