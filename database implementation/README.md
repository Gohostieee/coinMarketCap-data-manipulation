#what we have here is  a discord bot which makes use of various data libraties such as matplotlib in order

#to take the information from the crypto web scraper and plot them on command allowing us to visualize the data between two time frames

#it allows for multiple comparisons in one graph ie: comparing bitcoin and ethereum

#i actually was very confused when i first implemented this feature as comparing most of the major coins

#you can notice the gains and loses are pratically mirrored and it is extremely shady

#if eth goes up bit goes up, if eth goes down bit does down and vice versa

#this is probably due to the fact most people lump these currencies together and are not really taken into consideration individually

#however this was one of my very first serious projects where i was an edgy little teenager and thus most of the names arent really professional

#and some of the prints are  "questionable" tried to get rid of them, hopefully i didnt miss any of them
